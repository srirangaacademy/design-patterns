# design-patterns

## We will try to understand more details about the different design patters starting from the gange of four (GoF) to the latest cloud design patterns

## Structural Design patterns
### Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.


### Proxy pattern
#### What is proxy pattern?
* Proxy is a structural design pattern which lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for a real object.
* Controls the access to the real object and allows the implemented to perform something before or after the request processed by the real object
* This is one of the structual patterns. 

#### Some Examples

  * No need to carry cash
  * You can control how much you want to spend
  * No security related issues

#### types of proxies?
  * Remote Proxy (RMI/RPC)
  * Virtual Proxy (Lazy Loading)
  * Protection Proxy (Control based on access rights)

* When, where & how do we use proxy?
  * Lazy initialization
  * Access Control
